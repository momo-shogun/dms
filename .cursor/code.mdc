## Code Quality
- Follow KISS, DRY and SOLID principles
- No secrets or sensitive data in code
- Lint and format code before pushing
- Add helpful logging statements, don't expose any sensitive data or PII into log statements
- Avoid using any for types
- Update / Create little documentation at the file top/ method level
- Do minimal changes as possible
- spacing,padding and margin should be minimal .

## UI Components
- **Always first check** if component exists in `@ui/` folder (`/src/components/ui/`)
- **If component doesn't exist**, then use shadcn or radix ui components and import them
- Priority: @ui/ components > shadcn/radix ui > custom components
